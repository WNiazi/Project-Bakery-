## Technologies Used

* .NET 5.0


## Description
* Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:

* There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

* When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

* A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

* The application will return the total cost of the order.

* Pierre offers the following deals:

* Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free (every 3rd loaf of bread is free.). A single loaf costs $5, two loaves costs $10, and three loaves cost $10.
Pastry: Buy 1 for $2 or 3 for $5. Four pastries costs $7, five pastries costs $9, and six pastries costs $10.
* All functionality for the models should be tested.
