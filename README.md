## Description
__Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:

__There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

__When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

__A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

__The application will return the total cost of the order.

__Pierre offers the following deals:

__Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free (every 3rd loaf of bread is free.). A single loaf costs $5, two loaves costs $10, and three loaves cost $10.
Pastry: Buy 1 for $2 or 3 for $5. Four pastries costs $7, five pastries costs $9, and six pastries costs $10.
__All functionality for the models should be tested.
